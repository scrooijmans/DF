# Going to Market Strategy

## Overview
Our product serves a specialized geoscience / petrophysics market. To succeed, we need to carefully balance:
- **Low entry friction** (for consultants, academics, small companies).
- **High-value enterprise offerings** (for oil & gas and service providers).
- **Trust and transparency** (important in on-premise/self-hosted tools).

---

## Launch Strategies

### 1. Niche-first Strategy
- Target **consultants and small firms** first with the $99/month starter plan.
- Provide strong educational resources, tutorials, and demo datasets.
- Early adopters will give feedback and become product advocates.

### 2. Academic & Community Adoption
- Offer **academic licenses for free or discounted**.
- Build a pipeline of students and researchers familiar with the product.
- Academic adoption often drives enterprise interest later (as graduates enter industry).

### 3. Enterprise Sales
- Offer flat-rate enterprise licensing ($50k–150k/year).
- Provide **onboarding, training, and integration support**.
- Pitch the value: replacing expensive legacy workflows with a modern, lightweight alternative.

### 4. Open Source Core + Paid Extensions (Optional Future Path)
- Open-source a lightweight core (data access, basic transformations).
- Monetize enterprise modules (advanced UDFs, multi-user collaboration, security, support).
- Builds community trust and accelerates adoption.

### 5. Partnerships
- Partner with consulting firms, service companies, or cloud providers.
- Bundle the product as part of larger data solutions.
- Create integrations with popular ecosystems (Postgres, Iceberg, Arrow).

## Channels for Promotion
- **Direct sales**: conferences, geoscience workshops, LinkedIn outreach.
- **Community**: GitHub (if parts are open), technical blogs, webinars.
- **Academic**: university partnerships, teaching licenses.
- **Consultants**: early access for small firms to build case studies.
