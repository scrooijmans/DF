# Introduction - Formsnap

Formsnap takes the already incredible [sveltekit-superforms](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms) (winner of [Svelte Hack 2023](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/winners) for best library), made by the brilliant [Andreas Söderlund](https://github.com/ciscoheat) and wraps it with components that make it simpler to use while making your forms accessible by default.

## The Same Form, Two Ways

To showcase the value provided by Formsnap, let's take a look at a simple sign up form using only Superforms, and then using Superforms with Formsnap.

### Superforms Only

+page.svelte

That's quite a bit of code required to get a simple, accessible form up and running. We can't move as quickly as we'd like to, it's not very DRY, and is ripe for copy-paste errors.

All is not lost though, as the whole idea behind Formsnap is to make this process simpler, without sacrificing the flexibility that Superforms provides.

### Superforms + Formsnap

+page.svelte

That's it! We just condensed a bunch of code, while retaining the same functionality.
