# Better Context (`btca`)

https://btca.dev

`btca` is a CLI for asking questions about libraries/frameworks by cloning their repos locally and searching the source directly.

Dev docs are in the `apps/cli` directory.

## Install

```bash
bun add -g btca
btca --help
```

## Quick commands

Ask a question:

```bash
btca ask -t svelte -q "How do stores work in Svelte 5?"
```

Open the TUI:

```bash
btca chat -t svelte
```

Run as a server:

```bash
btca serve -p 8080
```

Then POST `/question` with:

```json
{
  "tech": "svelte",
  "question": "how does the query remote function work in sveltekit?"
}
```

Keep an OpenCode instance running:

```bash
btca open
```

## Config

On first run, `btca` creates a default config at `~/.config/btca/btca.json`. That’s where the repo list + model/provider live.
