Enviroment
A guide to using the Dokploy CLI to manage enviroment

The Dokploy CLI can be used to create, deploy, and manage enviroments.

Requirements
Is required to be already authenticated with the Dokploy CLI.

Commands
dokploy env pull <file> - Pull environment variables from Dokploy in a file.
dokploy env push <file> - Push environment variables to Dokploy from a file.


Environment Variables
Dokploy allows you to create and manage shared and service-level environment variables for your projects and environments.

Overview
Environment variables in Dokploy allow you to:

Define configuration once and reuse it
Share values across multiple services
Reference values from within the same service
Centrally manage sensitive information
Environment variables panel
Defining Variables
You can declare environment variables either:

Project-level (shared) — available across all services in the project
Environment-level — specific to a single environment
Service-level — specific to a single service
Project-Level Variables
Practical Example
Let's consider a common scenario where you have:

A PostgreSQL database
Two services that need to connect to this database
1. Define Shared Variable
In the project's shared variables section, define:


DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@database:5432/postgres
2. Use the Variable in Services
In each service's environment variables tab, reference the shared variable:


DATABASE_URL=${{project.DATABASE_URL}}
Dokploy will automatically replace ${{project.DATABASE_URL}} with the value defined in the project's shared variables.

You can use shared environment variables in all the services available in dokploy.

Environment-Level Variables
Practical Example
Let's consider a scenario where you have:

A staging environment with different database credentials
Multiple services that need environment-specific configurations
1. Define Environment Variable
In the environment's variables section, define:


DATABASE_PASSWORD=staging_secret_password
API_KEY=staging_api_key_12345
2. Use the Variable in Services
In each service's environment variables tab, reference the environment variable:


DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:${{environment.DATABASE_PASSWORD}}@staging-db:5432/postgres
EXTERNAL_API_KEY=${{environment.API_KEY}}
Dokploy will automatically replace ${{environment.VARIABLE_NAME}} with the value defined in the environment's variables.

You can use environment variables in all the services available in that specific environment.

Service-Level Variables
Service-level variables are specific to a single service and can be used to override shared variables or define service-specific configurations.

Practical Example
Let's say you have a service that requires a different database user. You can define a service-level variable:


DATABASE_USER=service_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=service_password
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${{DATABASE_USER}}:${{DATABASE_PASSWORD}}@service-database:5432/postgres
Preview Deployments environments also include a service-level variable called DOKPLOY_DEPLOY_URL, which points to the deployment URL of the service. It can be used as ${{DOKPLOY_DEPLOY_URL}} for variables like APP_URL=https://${{DOKPLOY_DEPLOY_URL}}.

Best Practices
Use shared variables for credentials and configurations that repeat across services
Keep descriptive variable names
Document the purpose of each variable for easier maintenance
