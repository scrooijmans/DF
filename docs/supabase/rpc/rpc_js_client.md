JavaScript: Using modifiers
===========================

Filters work on the row level—they allow you to return rows that only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows. Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition—allowing you to change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).

Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that returns a table response).
