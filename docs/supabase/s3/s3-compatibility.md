S3 Compatibility

==================

Learn about the compatibility of Supabase Storage with S3.

---

Supabase Storage is compatible with the S3 protocol. You can use any S3 client to interact with your Storage objects.

Storage supports standard, resumable and S3 uploads and all these protocols are interoperable. You can upload a file with the S3 protocol and list it with the REST API or upload with Resumable uploads and list with S3.

Storage supports presigning a URL using query parameters. Specifically, Supabase Storage expects requests to be made using AWS Signature Version 4. To enable this feature, enable the S3 connection via S3 protocol in the Settings page for Supabase Storage.

The S3 protocol is currently in Public Alpha. If you encounter any issues or have feature requests, contact us.
