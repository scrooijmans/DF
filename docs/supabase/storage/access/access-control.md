# Storage Access Control | Supabase Docs

---

Supabase Storage is designed to work perfectly with Postgres [Row Level Security](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) (RLS).

You can use RLS to create [Security Access Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html) that are incredibly powerful and flexible, allowing you to restrict access based on your business needs.

By default Storage does not allow any uploads to buckets without RLS policies. You selectively allow certain operations by creating RLS policies on the `storage.objects` table.

You can find the documentation for the storage schema [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/schema/design) , and to simplify the process of crafting your policies, you can utilize these [helper functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/schema/helper-functions) .

For example, the only RLS policy required for [uploading](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-upload) objects is to grant the `INSERT` permission to the `storage.objects` table.

To allow overwriting files using the `upsert` functionality you will need to additionally grant `SELECT` and `UPDATE` permissions.

An easy way to get started would be to create RLS policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations and restrict the policies to meet your security requirements. For example, one can start with the following `INSERT` policy:

```

1
2
3
4
5
create policy "policy_name"ON storage.objectsfor insert with check (  true);
```

and modify it to only allow authenticated users to upload assets to a specific bucket by changing it to:

```

1
2
3
4
5
create policy "policy_name"on storage.objects for insert to authenticated with check (    -- restrict bucket    bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id');
```

This example demonstrates how you would allow authenticated users to upload files to a folder called `private` inside `my_bucket_id`:

```

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"on storage.objectsfor insertto authenticatedwith check (  bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id' and  (storage.foldername(name))
[1] = 'private');
```

This example demonstrates how you would allow authenticated users to upload files to a folder called with their `users.id` inside `my_bucket_id`:

```

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"on storage.objectsfor insertto authenticatedwith check (  bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id' and  (storage.foldername(name))
[1] = (select auth.uid()::text));
```

Allow a user to access a file that was previously uploaded by the same user:

```

1
2
3
4
create policy "Individual user Access"on storage.objects for selectto authenticatedusing ( (select auth.uid()) = owner_id::uuid );
```

If you exclusively use Storage from trusted clients, such as your own servers, and need to bypass the RLS policies, you can use the `service key` in the `Authorization` header. Service keys entirely bypass RLS policies, granting you unrestricted access to all Storage APIs.

Remember you should not share the service key publicly.
