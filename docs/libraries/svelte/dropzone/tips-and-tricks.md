If you do not want the default message at all (»Drop files to upload (or click)«), you can put an element inside your dropzone element with the class dz-message and dropzone will not create the message for you.

Dropzone will submit any hidden fields you have in your dropzone form. So this is an easy way to submit additional data. You can also use the params option.

Dropzone adds data to the file object you can use when events fire. You can access file.width and file.height if it’s an image, as well as file.uploadwhich is an object containing: progress (0-100), total (the total bytes) and bytesSent.

If you want to add additional data to the file upload that has to be specific for each file, you can register for the sending event:

Copy
myDropzone.on("sending", function(file, xhr, formData) {
// Will send the filesize along with the file as POST data.
formData.append("filesize", file.size);
});
To access the preview html of a file, you can access file.previewElement. For example:

Copy
myDropzone.on("addedfile", function(file) {
file.previewElement.addEventListener("click", function() {
myDropzone.removeFile(file);
});
});
If you want the whole body to be a Dropzone and display the files somewhere else you can simply instantiate a Dropzone object for the body, and define thepreviewsContainer option. The previewsContainer should have thedropzone-previews or dropzone class to properly display the file previews.

Copy
new Dropzone(document.body, {
previewsContainer: ".dropzone-previews",
// You probably don't want the whole body
// to be clickable to select files
clickable: false
});
Look at the gitlab wiki for more examples.

If you have any problems using Dropzone, please try to find help on stackoverflow.com by using the dropzone.js tag. Only create an issue on GitLab when you think you found a bug or want to suggest a new feature.
