# RenderableSeries Overview

TheÂ RenderableSeriesÂ in SciChart are visual representations of **X,Y Numeric** or **Date** data. Other libraries call them 'Chart Types'.

Some RenderableSeries render simple X,Y values (2D points in space), while some render additional information (such as X,Y0,Y1 values, or X,Y,Z values).

## Chart Types in SciChart.js<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/renderable-series-api-overview/#chart-types-in-scichartjs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chart Types in SciChart.js" translate="no" title="Direct link to Chart Types in SciChart.js">â€‹</a>

SciChart.js supports a number of 2D & 3D Chart types. These include:

## CommonÂ 2D ChartÂ Features<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/renderable-series-api-overview/#common2d-chartfeatures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CommonÂ 2D ChartÂ Features" translate="no" title="Direct link to CommonÂ 2D ChartÂ Features">â€‹</a>

As well as just render 2D Data, a number of chart types support additional properties and features.

For example, most 2D Chart types in SciChart.js support:

| SciChart.js Feature | Description |
|----|----|
| **Dynamic Data Updates** | All SciChart.js chart types support dynamic updates to data out of the box. Insert, append, update, delete - modify data and the chart updates FAST. See the [DataSeries API documentation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/data-series-api/data-series-api-overview) for more details. |
| **Per-point coloring** | SciChart.js chart types support per-point coloring based on a rule. Xy values over/under a threshold, values with a property can be colored individually. See the [PaletteProvider API](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/palette-provider-api/palette-provider-api-overview) for more details. |
| **Data-point markers** | SciChart.js chart types support adding a pointmarker (circle, square, triangle, cross marker) at data-points. See the [PointMarkers documentation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/common-series-apis/drawing-point-markers) for more details. |
| **Data-point Text Labels** | SciChart.js supports fast, WebGL based text labels at datapoints, which can be customised. See the [DataLabels API](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/data-point-labels/data-labels-api-overview) for more details. |
| **Render Data Transforms** | Allows transforming data right before rendering. Used, for example, to add or remove data points just before rendering. See the [RenderDataTransforms API](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/render-data-transforms-api) |
| **Showing / hiding series** | You can show/hide series in SciChart.js as well as be notified when a series is hidden. See the [isVisibleChanged documentation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/common-series-apis/is-visible) for more details. |
| **Select series** | Using a ChartModifier (an attached behaviour) you can add Series Selection, Hover callbacks and styling into SciChart.js. See the [SeriesSelectionModifier documentation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-modifier-api/selection/series-selection) for more details. |
| **Select data-points** | Using a ChartModifier (attached behaviour), you can add data-point selection detection, callbacks and styling into SciChart.js. See the [DataPointSelectionModifier](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-modifier-api/selection/data-point-selection) docs for more details. |
| **Tooltips and Cursors** | Of course, SciChart.js supports customisable tooltips and cursors using ChartModifiers (attached behaviour). See the [CursorModifier](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-modifier-api/cursor-modifier/cursor-modifier-overview) or [RolloverModifier](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-modifier-api/rollover-modifier) docs for more details. |
| **Nulls (Gaps) in Data** | For line charts, mountain charts and 2D cartesian chart types you can draw nulls (gaps) in data, or even change style in the line using a technique we have. See the [Drawing Gaps in Series](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/common-series-apis/drawing-gaps) documentation for more details. |

We are continually improving and adding features to SciChart.js. Some of the things on the roadmap are: more chart types, more interactions & even allowing custom drawing.

## The RenderableSeries Class<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/renderable-series-api-overview/#the-renderableseries-class" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The RenderableSeries Class" translate="no" title="Direct link to The RenderableSeries Class">â€‹</a>

All 2D Chart types in SciChart.js are derived from theÂ <a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/baserenderableseries.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BaseRenderableSeriesðŸ“˜</a>Â type. This is a JavaScript class which is added to theÂ <a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/scichartsurface.html#renderableseries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sciChartSurface.renderableSeriesðŸ“˜</a> collection and is rendered using our own proprietaryÂ WebAssembly / WebGLÂ based rendering engine.

Each RenderableSeries is rendered to the screen, displaying the data from an associatedÂ [DataSeries](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/data-series-api/data-series-api-overview).

### Constructor options on RenderableSeries<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/2d-charts/chart-types/renderable-series-api-overview/#constructor-options-on-renderableseries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Constructor options on RenderableSeries" translate="no" title="Direct link to Constructor options on RenderableSeries">â€‹</a>

Every RenderableSeries has a set of constructor options allowing for fast initialization and setup by passing in a javascript object. Each property reflected on the series has an optional constructor option parameter.

For example this code:

**Setting properties of series**

``` prism-code
const lineSeries = new FastLineRenderableSeries(wasmContext);
lineSeries.stroke = "Red";
lineSeries.strokeThickness = 3;
lineSeries.dataSeries = new XyDataSeries(wasmContext, {xValues, yValues});
lineSeries.isVisible = true;
lineSeries.opacity = 0.7;
```

is equivalent to this:

**Constructor parameters of series**

``` prism-code
const lineSeries = new FastLineRenderableSeries(wasmContext, {
    stroke: "Red",
    strokeThickness: 3,
    dataSeries: new XyDataSeries(wasmContext, {xValues, yValues}),
    isVisible: true,
    opacity: 0.7
});
```
