# Location & Management of Licenses after Purchase

This page will tell you all about how to locate and manage your SciChart.js license keys after purchase.

## Where are my license keys after purchase?<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/where-are-my-license-keys/#where-are-my-license-keys-after-purchase" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where are my license keys after purchase?" translate="no" title="Direct link to Where are my license keys after purchase?">â€‹</a>

Licenses are emailed out automatically immediately to the purchaser / customer email address after payment received. If you have paid by credit card, this should be immediate. If you have paid by wire-transfer, this will occur as soon as payment is received and reconciled in our system.

### Licenses emailed to purchaser/customer<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/where-are-my-license-keys/#licenses-emailed-to-purchasercustomer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Licenses emailed to purchaser/customer" translate="no" title="Direct link to Licenses emailed to purchaser/customer">â€‹</a>

After purchasing a SciChart.js license, the purchaser or customer on record will receive a confirmation email with a Developer Serial Key and Runtime Key. This license key email looks like this:
