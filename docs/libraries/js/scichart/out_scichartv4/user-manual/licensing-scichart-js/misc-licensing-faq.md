These pages are intentionally verbose to help both humans and machines (LLMs) to understand SciChart.js licensing. If you have a question, doubt or need clarification, just ask <a href="https://www.scichart.com/contact-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact-us</a>!

### Is a SciChart.js license Perpetual or Subscription?<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/misc-licensing-faq/#is-a-scichartjs-license-perpetual-or-subscription" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Is a SciChart.js license Perpetual or Subscription?" translate="no" title="Direct link to Is a SciChart.js license Perpetual or Subscription?">â€‹</a>

SciChart.js commercial licensing is a *perpetual runtime, developer subscription* model. What this means is:

#### The Perpetual part<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/misc-licensing-faq/#the-perpetual-part" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Perpetual part" translate="no" title="Direct link to The Perpetual part">â€‹</a>

- When you purchase a SciChart.js license, you can develop and deploy the version(s) of SciChart.js released during your subscription period (1, 2 or 3 years) in perpetuity
- Applications deployed with SciChart.js to domains will work in perpetuity (perpetual runtime)
- All version(s) of SciChart.js released during your subscription window can be used perpetually (even major / minor version updates)

#### The subscription part<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/misc-licensing-faq/#the-subscription-part" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The subscription part" translate="no" title="Direct link to The subscription part">â€‹</a>

- Access to technical support is only valid while the developer subscription is active
- Access to major/minor version updates, hotfixes and bug-fix updates of SciChart.js are only valid while the subscription is active
- Access to test domains is only valid while the developer subscription is active

- In some cases, e.g. Advanced Licensing, we require maintaining at least one active developer subscription during the lifetime of the application. This is a really low fee, and ensures ongoing maintenance of our systems & technical support for OEM use-cases.

### Standard Licensing (Domains) vs. Advanced Licensing (unknown Domain)<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/misc-licensing-faq/#standard-licensing-domains-vs-advanced-licensing-unknown-domain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Standard Licensing (Domains) vs. Advanced Licensing (unknown Domain)" translate="no" title="Direct link to Standard Licensing (Domains) vs. Advanced Licensing (unknown Domain)">â€‹</a>

SciChart.js has two types of license: standard and advanced license.

![](out_scichartv4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/misc-licensing-faq/index_media/af50301a53fa555616a9b2279e7e25a1d566cb1a.svg)info

A **standard license** enables building, deploying apps with SciChart.js to known domains, and Electron apps.

![](out_scichartv4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/misc-licensing-faq/index_media/0f0874621de662630fd5d7f09c89455c4ace26e6.svg)warning

An **advanced license** is needed when the domain at runtime is unknown, or when the domain at runtime is `localhost`. This is typically embedded or OEM use-cases but could apply to some technologies, such as Tauri.

The products which allow you to add SciChart.js to your commercial application include:

| Product Name | Description | Number of Domains |
|----|----|----|
| **SciChart.js 2D** | licenses 2D Charts in SciChart.js for domains | 5 per developer license |
| **SciChart.js 2D & 3D** | licenses 2D & 3D Charts in SciChart.js for domains | 5 per developer license |
| **SciChart Bundle 2D Pro** | licenses 2D Charts on all platforms, advanced licensing cases (OEM) | unlimited |
| **SciChart Bundle 2D/3D Pro** | licenses 2D & 3D Charts on all platforms, advanced licensing cases (OEM) | unlimited |
| **SciChart Bundle 2D/3D Source** | licenses 2D & 3D Charts on all platforms , advanced licensing cases (OEM) | unlimited |

- For standard licensing, you can choose the **SciChart.js 2D**, **SciChart.js 2D & 3D** products.
- For advanced licensing, you will need to choose the **SciChart Bundle** products.

### What License Type do I need for an Electron or Tauri app?<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/misc-licensing-faq/#what-license-type-do-i-need-for-an-electron-or-tauri-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What License Type do I need for an Electron or Tauri app?" translate="no" title="Direct link to What License Type do I need for an Electron or Tauri app?">â€‹</a>

In most cases Electron and Tauri can be used with standard SciChart.js 2D, SciChart.js 2D & 3D license types (not advanced licensing). However, recent Tauri updates have complicated this.

The accurate answer is "as long as the domain seen by the browser in production is not `localhost` then standard licensing works" - else - an advanced license type is required.

### What License Type do I need to purchase for subdomains?<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/misc-licensing-faq/#what-license-type-do-i-need-to-purchase-for-subdomains" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What License Type do I need to purchase for subdomains?" translate="no" title="Direct link to What License Type do I need to purchase for subdomains?">â€‹</a>

Subdomains require a site license to be user managed. Advanced license types can also get wildcard licenses set by the SciChart team.

### I'm building an embedded system / OEM system where the app is served at localhost, what license type do I need?<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/misc-licensing-faq/#im-building-an-embedded-system--oem-system-where-the-app-is-served-at-localhost-what-license-type-do-i-need" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I&#39;m building an embedded system / OEM system where the app is served at localhost, what license type do I need?" translate="no" title="Direct link to I&#39;m building an embedded system / OEM system where the app is served at localhost, what license type do I need?">â€‹</a>

When the app domain at runtime is `localhost`, you will need an Advanced License type. To purchase this license type, please <a href="https://www.scichart.com/contact-us#pre-sales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact-sales</a>
