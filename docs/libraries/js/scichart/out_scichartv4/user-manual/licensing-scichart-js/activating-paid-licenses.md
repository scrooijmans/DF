Full troubleshooting steps can be found at the page [scichart.js licensing troubleshooting](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/licensing-troubleshooting/)

### The machine I'm trying to activate is offline or cannot reach the licensing servers<a href="https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/user-manual/licensing-scichart-js/activating-paid-licenses/#the-machine-im-trying-to-activate-is-offline-or-cannot-reach-the-licensing-servers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The machine I&#39;m trying to activate is offline or cannot reach the licensing servers" translate="no" title="Direct link to The machine I&#39;m trying to activate is offline or cannot reach the licensing servers">â€‹</a>

When starting the licensing wizard, if the server is unreachable (e.g. proxy settings or your internet connection), a warning will be displayed "Unable to connect to licensing server"

If the machine you are trying to activate is offline, airgapped, has no internet connection or otherwise cannot reach the activation servers, you can also use offline activation.

This uses an email service/loop to generate a license key for the machine.

1.  Start the licensing wizard and enter your scichart.com username and password **Check these are correct before submitting**
