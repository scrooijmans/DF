Installation requirements
=========================

The following sections describe the requirements for deploying Qdrant.

CPU and memory
--------------

The preferred size of your CPU and RAM depends on:

*   Number of vectors
*   Vector dimensions
*   Payloads and their indexes
*   Storage
*   Replication
*   How you configure quantization

Our Cloud Pricing Calculator can help you estimate required resources without payload or index data.

### Supported CPU architectures:

**64-bit system:**

*   x86\_64/amd64
*   AArch64/arm64

**32-bit system:**

*   Not supported

### Storage

For persistent storage, Qdrant requires block-level access to storage devices with a POSIX-compatible file system. Network systems such as iSCSI that provide block-level access are also acceptable. Qdrant won’t work with Network file systems such as NFS, or Object storage systems such as S3.

If you offload vectors to a local disk, we recommend you use a solid-state (SSD or NVMe) drive.

### Networking

Each Qdrant instance requires three open ports:

*   `6333` - For the HTTP API, for the Monitoring health and metrics endpoints
*   `6334` - For the gRPC API
*   `6335` - For Distributed deployment

All Qdrant instances in a cluster must be able to:

*   Communicate with each other over these ports
*   Allow incoming connections to ports `6333` and `6334` from clients that use Qdrant.

### Security

The default configuration of Qdrant might not be secure enough for every situation. Please see our security documentation for more information.

Installation options
--------------------

Qdrant can be installed in different ways depending on your needs:

For production, you can use our Qdrant Cloud to run Qdrant either fully managed in our infrastructure or with Hybrid Cloud in yours.

If you want to run Qdrant in your own infrastructure, without any cloud connection, we recommend to install Qdrant in a Kubernetes cluster with our Qdrant Private Cloud Enterprise Operator.

For testing or development setups, you can run the Qdrant container or as a binary executable. We also provide a Helm chart for an easy installation in Kubernetes.

Production
----------

### Qdrant Cloud

You can set up production with the Qdrant Cloud, which provides fully managed Qdrant databases. It provides horizontal and vertical scaling, one click installation and upgrades, monitoring, logging, as well as backup and disaster recovery. For more information, see the Qdrant Cloud documentation.

### Qdrant Kubernetes Operator

We provide a Qdrant Enterprise Operator for Kubernetes installations as part of our Qdrant Private Cloud offering. For more information, use this form to contact us.

### Kubernetes

You can use a ready-made Helm Chart to run Qdrant in your Kubernetes cluster. While it is possible to deploy Qdrant in a distributed setup with the Helm chart, it does not come with the same level of features for zero-downtime upgrades, up and down-scaling, monitoring, logging, and backup and disaster recovery as the Qdrant Cloud offering or the Qdrant Private Cloud Enterprise Operator. Instead you must manage and set this up yourself. Support for the Helm chart is limited to community support.

The following table gives you an overview about the feature differences between the Qdrant Cloud and the Helm chart:

| Feature | Qdrant Helm Chart | Qdrant Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open-source | ✅ |  |
| Community support only | ✅ |  |
| Quick to get started | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vertical and horizontal scaling | ✅ | ✅ |
| API keys with granular access control | ✅ | ✅ |
| Qdrant version upgrades | ✅ | ✅ |
| Support for transit and storage encryption | ✅ | ✅ |
| Zero-downtime upgrades with optimized restart strategy |  | ✅ |
| Production ready out-of the box |  | ✅ |
| Dataloss prevention on downscaling |  | ✅ |
| Full cluster backup and disaster recovery |  | ✅ |
| Automatic shard rebalancing |  | ✅ |
| Re-sharding support |  | ✅ |
| Automatic persistent volume scaling |  | ✅ |
| Advanced telemetry |  | ✅ |
| One-click API key revoking |  | ✅ |
| Recreating nodes with new volumes in existing cluster |  | ✅ |
| Enterprise support |  | ✅ |

To install the helm chart:

```bash
helm repo add qdrant https://qdrant.to/helm
helm install qdrant qdrant/qdrant
```

For more information, see the qdrant-helm README.

### Docker and Docker Compose

Usually, we recommend to run Qdrant in Kubernetes, or use the Qdrant Cloud for production setups. This makes setting up highly available and scalable Qdrant clusters with backups and disaster recovery a lot easier.

However, you can also use Docker and Docker Compose to run Qdrant in production, by following the setup instructions in the Docker and Docker Compose Development sections. In addition, you have to make sure:

*   To use a performant persistent storage for your data
*   To configure the security settings for your deployment
*   To set up and configure Qdrant on multiple nodes for a highly available distributed deployment
*   To set up a load balancer for your Qdrant cluster
*   To create a backup and disaster recovery strategy for your data
*   To integrate Qdrant with your monitoring and logging solutions

Development
-----------

For development and testing, we recommend that you set up Qdrant in Docker. We also have different client libraries.

### Docker

The easiest way to start using Qdrant for testing or development is to run the Qdrant container image. The latest versions are always available on DockerHub.

Make sure that Docker, Podman or the container runtime of your choice is installed and running. The following instructions use Docker.

Pull the image:

```bash
docker pull qdrant/qdrant
```

In the following command, revise `$(pwd)/path/to/data` for your Docker configuration. Then use the updated command to run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 \
-v $(pwd)/path/to/data:/qdrant/storage \
qdrant/qdrant
```

With this command, you start a Qdrant instance with the default configuration. It stores all data in the `./path/to/data` directory.

By default, Qdrant uses port 6333, so at localhost:6333 you should see the welcome message.

To change the Qdrant configuration, you can overwrite the production configuration:

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 \
-v $(pwd)/path/to/data:/qdrant/storage \
-v $(pwd)/path/to/custom_config.yaml:/qdrant/config/production.yaml \
qdrant/qdrant
```

Alternatively, you can use your own `custom_config.yaml` configuration file:

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 \
-v $(pwd)/path/to/data:/qdrant/storage \
-v $(pwd)/path/to/custom_config.yaml:/qdrant/config/custom_config.yaml \
qdrant/qdrant \
./qdrant --config-path config/custom_config.yaml
```

For more information, see the Configuration documentation.

### Docker Compose

You can also use Docker Compose to run Qdrant.

Here is an example customized compose file for a single node Qdrant cluster:

```yaml
services:
qdrant:
image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
restart: always
container_name: qdrant
ports:
- 6333:6333
- 6334:6334
expose:
- 6333
- 6334
- 6335
configs:
- source: qdrant_config
target: /qdrant/config/production.yaml
volumes:
- ./qdrant_data:/qdrant/storage

configs:
qdrant_config:
content: |
log_level: INFO
```

Proving the inline `content` in the configs top-level element requires Docker Compose v2.23.1 or above. This functionality is supported starting Docker Engine v25.0.0 and Docker Desktop v4.26.0 onwards.

### From source

Qdrant is written in Rust and can be compiled into a binary executable. This installation method can be helpful if you want to compile Qdrant for a specific processor architecture or if you do not want to use Docker.

Before compiling, make sure that the necessary libraries and the rust toolchain are installed. The current list of required libraries can be found in the Dockerfile.

Build Qdrant with Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin qdrant
```

After a successful build, you can find the binary in the following subdirectory `./target/release/qdrant`.

Client libraries
----------------

In addition to the service, Qdrant provides a variety of client libraries for different programming languages. For a full list, see our Client libraries documentation.
