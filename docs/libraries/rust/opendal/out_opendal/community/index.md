### How to subscribe to a mailing list<a href="https://opendal.apache.org/community/#how-to-subscribe-to-a-mailing-list" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to subscribe to a mailing list" translate="no" title="Direct link to How to subscribe to a mailing list">â€‹</a>

Before you can post a message to a mailing list, you need to subscribe to the list first.

1.  Send an email without any contents or subject to <a href="mailto:listname-subscribe@opendal.apache.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listname-subscribe@opendal.apache.org</a>. (replace listname with dev or user)
2.  Wait till you receive an email with the subject "confirm subscribe to <a href="mailto:listname@opendal.apache.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listname@opendal.apache.org</a>". Reply to that email, without editing the subject or including any contents.
3.  Wait till you receive an email with the subject "WELCOME to <a href="mailto:listname@opendal.apache.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listname@opendal.apache.org</a>".

If you email us with a code snippet, make sure that:

- you do not link to files in external services as such files can change, get deleted or the link might break and thus make an archived email thread useless
- you paste text instead of screenshots of text
- you keep formatting when pasting code to keep the code readable
- there are enough import statements to avoid ambiguities

## Issue tracker<a href="https://opendal.apache.org/community/#issue-tracker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Issue tracker" translate="no" title="Direct link to Issue tracker">â€‹</a>

We use GitHub Issues to track all code related issues: <a href="https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues</a>

You must have a <a href="https://github.com/signup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> to log cases and issues.

### Bug reports<a href="https://opendal.apache.org/community/#bug-reports" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bug reports" translate="no" title="Direct link to Bug reports">â€‹</a>

Found bug? Enter an issue in the issue tracker.

Before submitting an issue, please:

- Verify that the bug does in fact exist.
- Search the issue tracker to verify there is no existing issue reporting the bug you've found.
- Consider tracking down the bug yourself in the source code of OpenDAL and submitting a patch along with your bug report. This is a great time saver for the OpenDAL developers and helps ensure the bug will be fixed quickly.

### Enhancement<a href="https://opendal.apache.org/community/#enhancement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhancement" translate="no" title="Direct link to Enhancement">â€‹</a>

Enhancements or new feature proposals are also welcome. The more concrete and rationale the proposal is, the greater the chance it will be incorporated into future releases.

## Upcoming Community Events<a href="https://opendal.apache.org/community/#upcoming-community-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upcoming Community Events" translate="no" title="Direct link to Upcoming Community Events">â€‹</a>

For now, we have a single community event known as the Community Sync Meeting. This meeting is open to everyone.

During the meeting, we will cover various topics including project status, roadmap updates, and other relevant discussions. We will also have a Q&A session at the end of the meeting.

Attending the meeting presents a valuable opportunity for you to meet fellow community members and gain deeper insights into the project. Moreover, it provides an excellent chance for active involvement in the project's activities.

We currently organize the community sync meeting every three weeks, with one scheduled at 09:00 UTC+8 and the other at 19:00 UTC+8. These two meeting times alternate between each three-week cycle.

The following is the calendar of the community events:
