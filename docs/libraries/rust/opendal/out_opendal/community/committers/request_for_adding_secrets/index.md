# Request for adding secrets

OpenDAL's behavior tests depend on the secrets stored in 1password.

If you want to sponsor any service, please email <a href="mailto:private@opendal.apache.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">private@opendal.apache.org</a> with the subject line `Request to Add Secrets for <service>`. Our PMC will review the request and reply to you.

After the request is approved, you can use the secrets in the behavior tests when they are running on the GitHub Actions (You need to be a committer of OpenDAL).

The email should also include the following information:

- The name of the service
- The secrets in key-value pairs

If the secrets have expiration dates, please also include the expiration dates. We may need you to update the secrets in the future.

If the secrets are not under your control, please also include the contact information of the owner of the secrets.

And finally, thank you for your support!
