If you receive an email with the subject "WELCOME to <a href="mailto:private@opendal.apache.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">private@opendal.apache.org</a>", you have successfully subscribed to the private mailing list.

It's required for PMC members to subscribe the private mailing list. The private list is only for confidential discussions that should not be made public, such as the suitability of a particular individual to become a committer or a member of the PMC.

Once you have been added to OpenDAL's PMC member list, you will gain the access to all OpenDAL's secrets.
