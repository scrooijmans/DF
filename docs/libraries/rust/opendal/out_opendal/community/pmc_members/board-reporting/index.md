# Board reporting

Apache PMC members are responsible for reporting the status of their projects to the Apache Board of Directors. This page provides guidance on how to prepare and submit reports for Apache OpenDALâ„¢.

### Frequency of Reporting<a href="https://opendal.apache.org/community/pmc_members/board-reporting/#frequency-of-reporting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Frequency of Reporting" translate="no" title="Direct link to Frequency of Reporting">â€‹</a>

New graduates from the Apache Incubator are required to report monthly for the first three months, then quarterly.

**The current reporting frequency for Apache OpenDALâ„¢ is once per quarter.**

### Report Preparation<a href="https://opendal.apache.org/community/pmc_members/board-reporting/#report-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Report Preparation" translate="no" title="Direct link to Report Preparation">â€‹</a>

It's recommended to discuss the report on <a href="mailto:dev@opendal.apache.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dev@opendal.apache.org</a> (<a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@opendal.apache.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">subscribe</a>), inviting all members to contribute. Here are the critical points your report should address:

- Any concerns that require the attention of the ASF Board.
- Legal, infrastructure, cross-project, or personal issues that need addressing.
- Achievements (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report.
- Any other significant points or thoughts you think should be included.

You can discuss the issues based on the template or refer to <a href="https://hackmd.io/@opendal/asf-board-report-2024-04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous reports</a> for preparation.

### Report Writing and Submission<a href="https://opendal.apache.org/community/pmc_members/board-reporting/#report-writing-and-submission" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Report Writing and Submission" translate="no" title="Direct link to Report Writing and Submission">â€‹</a>

The report should be written in Markdown format and submitted to the Apache Board of Directors via the <a href="https://reporter.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Board Reporting Service</a>.
