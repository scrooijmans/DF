Hello, everyone!

We're writing this blog post to announce that the Apache OpenDALâ„¢ Project will be participating in <a href="https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open Source Promotion Plan (OSPP) 2024</a>. If you're not eligible or interested in participating in OSPP, then most of this post likely isn't relevant to you; if you are, this should contain some useful information and links.

Open Source Promotion Plan is a summer program organized by the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences and long-term supported by the Open Source Software Supply Chain Promotion Plan. It aims to encourage college students to actively participate in the maintenance and development of open source software, promote the vigorous development of open source software communities, and build the open source software supply chain together.

The OSPP applicants now have several weeks to send project proposals to organizations that appeal to them. If their project proposal is accepted, they will embark on a 12-week journey during which they will try to complete their proposed project under the guidance of an assigned mentor.

We have prepared <a href="https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues/4554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a list of project ideas</a> that can serve as inspiration for potential OSPP contributors that would like to send a project proposal to the OpenDAL project. You can try to find mentors on the <a href="mailto:dev@opendal.apache.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maillist</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/XQy8yGR2dg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discord</a>. We have also prepared <a href="https://opendal.apache.org/community/events/ospp-proposal-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a proposal guide</a> that should help you with preparing your project proposals.

You can start discussing the project ideas with OpenDAL Project maintainers immediately. The project proposal application period starts on April 30, 2024, and ends on June 4, 2024. Take note of that deadline, as there will be no extensions!

If you are interested in contributing to the OpenDAL Project, we encourage you to check out our project idea list and send us a OSPP project proposal! Of course, you are also free to discuss these projects and/or try to move them forward even if you do not intend to (or cannot) participate in OSPP. We welcome all contributors to OpenDAL, as there is always enough work to do.

We are excited about this event. Hoping you all feel the same way!
