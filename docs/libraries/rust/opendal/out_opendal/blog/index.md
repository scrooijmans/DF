## [Apache OpenDAL 2025 Roadmap: Perfecting Production Adoption](https://opendal.apache.org/blog/2025/03/01/2025-roadmap/)

Hi everyone, long time no see. Although we have been actively developing OpenDAL and consistently releasing updates, we havenâ€™t provided a clear overview of where OpenDAL is heading. This post aims to address that. Here, we will discuss OpenDAL's current position and the future directions we are moving toward.

I hope this post serves as a guide for our development, encourages more people to contribute, and ultimately helps achieve the vision of OpenDAL.

## [Apache OpenDALâ„¢ Internal: Data Reading](https://opendal.apache.org/blog/how-opendal-read-data/)

As the Apache OpenDALâ„¢ community continues to grow, new abstractions are constantly being added, which has brought some burdens to new contributors participating in development. Many maintainers hope to have a deeper understanding of OpenDAL's internal implementation. At the same time, OpenDAL's core design has not changed significantly for a long time, making it possible to write a series on internal implementation. I believe now is the time to write a series of articles on OpenDAL's internal implementation, to explain from the maintainer's perspective how OpenDAL is designed, implemented, and how it can be expanded. With the impending release of OpenDAL v0.40, I hope this series of articles will better help the community understand the past, master the present, and shape the future.

The first article will discuss OpenDAL's most commonly used data reading function. I will start from the outermost interface and then gradually unfold according to the calling sequence of OpenDAL. Let's get started!
