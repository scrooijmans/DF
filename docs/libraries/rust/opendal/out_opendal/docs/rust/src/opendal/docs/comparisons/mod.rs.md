18//! Compare opendal with other projects to find out the differences and areas that opendal can improve.
19//!
20//! All documents listed should be treated as highly biased. Because:
21//!
22//! - OpenDAL's maintainers and contributors write them.
23//! - Writers may not be familiar with the compared projects (at least not as familiar with OpenDAL)
24//!
25//! Let's see OpenDAL:
26//!
27//! - [vs `object_store`][`vs_object_store`]
