Command Line Interface
======================

The Tauri command line interface (CLI) is the way to interact with Tauri throughout the development lifecycle.

You can add the Tauri CLI to your current project using your package manager of choice:

*   npm
*   yarn
*   pnpm
*   deno
*   cargo

```
npm install --save-dev @tauri-apps/cli@latest
```

```
yarn add -D @tauri-apps/cli@latest
```

```
pnpm add -D @tauri-apps/cli@latest
```

```
deno add -D npm:@tauri-apps/cli@latest
```

```
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0" --locked
```

```
Run your app in development mode with hot-reloading for the Rust code. It makes use of the `build.devUrl` property from your `tauri.conf.json` file. It also runs your `build.beforeDevCommand` which usually starts your frontend devServer.
Usage: tauri dev [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...
Arguments:  [ARGS]...          Command line arguments passed to the runner. Use `--` to explicitly mark the start of the arguments. Arguments after a second `--` are passed to the application e.g. `tauri dev -- [runnerArgs] -- [appArgs]`
Options:  -r, --runner <RUNNER>          Binary to use to run the application
-v, --verbose...          Enables verbose logging

-e, --exit-on-panic          Exit on panic
-c, --config <CONFIG>          JSON strings or paths to JSON, JSON5 or TOML files to merge with the default configuration file
Configurations are merged in the order they are provided, which means a particular value overwrites previous values when a config key-value pair conflicts.
Note that a platform-specific file is looked up and merged with the default file by default (tauri.macos.conf.json, tauri.linux.conf.json, tauri.windows.conf.json, tauri.android.conf.json and tauri.ios.conf.json) but you can use this for more specific use cases such as different build flavors.
--release          Run the code in release mode
--no-dev-server-wait          Skip waiting for the frontend dev server to start before building the tauri application
[env: TAURI_CLI_NO_DEV_SERVER_WAIT=]

```

```
Build your app in release mode and generate bundles and installers. It makes use of the `build.frontendDist` property from your `tauri.conf.json` file. It also runs your `build.beforeBuildCommand` which usually builds your frontend into `build.frontendDist`. This will also run `build.beforeBundleCommand` before generating the bundles and installers of your app.
Usage: tauri build [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...
Arguments:  [ARGS]...          Command line arguments passed to the runner. Use `--` to explicitly mark the start of the arguments

-d, --debug          Builds with the debug flag
-t, --target <TARGET>          Target triple to build against.
It must be one of the values outputted by `$rustc --print target-list` or `universal-apple-darwin` for an universal macOS application.

-c, --config <CONFIG>          JSON strings or paths to JSON, JSON5 or TOML files to merge with the default configuration file
Configurations are merged in the order they are provided, which means a particular value overwrites previous values when a config key-value pair conflicts.

Run your app in development mode on Android with hot-reloading for the Rust code. It makes use of the `build.devUrl` property from your `tauri.conf.json` file. It also runs your `build.beforeDevCommand` which usually starts your frontend devServer.
Usage: tauri android dev [OPTIONS] [DEVICE] [-- <ARGS>...]
Arguments:  [DEVICE]          Runs on the given device name
[ARGS]...          Command line arguments passed to the runner. Use `--` to explicitly mark the start of the arguments. e.g. `tauri android dev -- [runnerArgs]`
Options:  -f, --features [<FEATURES>...]          List of cargo features to activate
-v, --verbose...          Enables verbose logging
-e, --exit-on-panic          Exit on panic
-c, --config <CONFIG>          JSON strings or paths to JSON, JSON5 or TOML files to merge with the default configuration file
Configurations are merged in the order they are provided, which means a particular value overwrites previous values when a config key-value pair conflicts.
Note that a platform-specific file is looked up and merged with the default file by default (tauri.macos.conf.json, tauri.linux.conf.json, tauri.windows.conf.json, tauri.android.conf.json and tauri.ios.conf.json) but you can use this for more specific use cases such as different build flavors.
--release          Run the code in release mode
--no-dev-server-wait          Skip waiting for the frontend dev server to start before building the tauri application
[env: TAURI_CLI_NO_DEV_SERVER_WAIT=]
--no-watch          Disable the file watcher
-o, --open          Open Android Studio instead of trying to run on a connected device
--force-ip-prompt          Force prompting for an IP to use to connect to the dev server on mobile
--host [<HOST>]          Use the public network address for the development server. If an actual address it provided, it is used instead of prompting to pick one.
On Windows we use the public network address by default.
This option is particularly useful along the `--open` flag when you intend on running on a physical device.
This replaces the devUrl configuration value to match the public network address host, it is your responsibility to set up your development server to listen on this address by using 0.0.0.0 as host for instance.
When this is set or when running on an iOS device the CLI sets the `TAURI_DEV_HOST` environment variable so you can check this on your framework's configuration to expose the development server on the public network address.
[default: <none>]
--no-dev-server          Disable the built-in dev server for static files
--port <PORT>          Specify port for the built-in dev server for static files. Defaults to 1430

-h, --help          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
