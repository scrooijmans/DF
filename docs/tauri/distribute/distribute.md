Distribute
==========

Tauri provides the tooling you need to distribute your application either to the platform app stores or as platform-specific installers.

Building
--------

Section titled “Building”

Tauri builds your application directly from its CLI via the `build`, `android build` and `ios build` commands.

*   npm
*   yarn
*   pnpm
*   deno
*   bun
*   cargo

```
npm run tauri build
```

```
yarn tauri build
```

```
pnpm tauri build
```

```
deno task tauri build
```

```
bun tauri build
```

```
cargo tauri build
```

See the distributing section to learn more about the configuration options available for each bundle and how to distribute them to your users.

Note

Most platforms requires code signing. See the signing section for more information.

### Bundling

Section titled “Bundling”

By default the `build` command automatically bundles your application for the configured formats.

If you need further customization on how the platform bundles are generated, you can split the build and bundle steps:

*   npm
*   yarn
*   pnpm
*   deno
*   bun
*   cargo

```
npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Storenpm run tauri bundle -- --bundles app,dmg# bundle for App Store distributionnpm run tauri bundle -- --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
```

```

```
cargo tauri build --no-bundle# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Storecargo tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg# bundle for App Store distributioncargo tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
```

Versioning
----------

Section titled “Versioning”

Your application version can be defined in the `tauri.conf.json > version` configuration option, which is the recommended way for managing the app version. If that config value is not set, Tauri uses the `package > version` value from your `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` file instead.

Note

Some platforms have some limitations and special cases for the version string. See the individual distribution documentation pages for more information.

Signing
-------

Section titled “Signing”

Code signing enhances the security of your application by applying a digital signature to your application’s executables and bundles, validating your identity of the provider of your application.

Signing is required on most platforms. See the documentation for each platform for more information.

macOS Code signing and notarization for macOS apps

Windows Code signing Windows installers

Linux Code signing Linux packages

Android Code signing for Android

iOS Code signing for iOS

Distributing
------------

Section titled “Distributing”

Learn how to distribute your application for each platform.

### Linux

Section titled “Linux”

For Linux you can distribute your app using the Debian package, Snap, AppImage, Flatpak, RPM or Arch User Repository (AUR) formats.

AppImage Distribute as an AppImage

Debian Distribute as a Debian package

Flathub Distribute as a Flatpak

RPM Distribute as an RPM package

Snapcraft Distribute on Snapcraft.io

Code signing

### macOS

Section titled “macOS”

For macOS you can either distribute your application directly to the App Store or ship a DMG installer as direct download. Both methods requires code signing, and distributing outside the App Store also requires notarization.

App Bundle Distribute macOS apps as an App Bundle

App Store Distribute iOS and macOS apps to the App Store

DMG Distribute macOS apps as Apple Disk Images

Code signing and notarization
