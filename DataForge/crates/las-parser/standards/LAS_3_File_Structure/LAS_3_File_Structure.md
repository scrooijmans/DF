# **LAS Version 3.0 Discussion**

The LAS format began with the desire for a simple format to exchange well log data. The world-wide acceptance of LAS proved the need for such a format. As users embraced the concept and the format, many new applications of the concept were attempted. As data users, we have all been tempted to put more data into our LAS files than the format was originally designed to handle. This led to the realization that LAS needed to expand.

LAS 3.0 was originally proposed as an update to LAS 2.0, with just minor changes to handle more well log data, such as multiple logging runs. But, like a ball rolling down a hill, the process quickly gained speed. What we are now presenting is a major redesign of the LAS format. We have maintained the founding principles of LAS, and those using LAS 3.0 for log data alone will find that the format is much the same as previous versions. However, those wishing to use LAS 3.0 for other data types will find in this format the expanded flexibility to accurately and completely describe their data.

Originally LAS was designed around a collection of file "sections". Each section began with a title line, and that title line was marked with a tilde ("~") at the beginning of the line. This design has been maintained, and we have added several new sections, plus added the rules for adding user-defined sections.

The standard will be released in two major parts. This first part will describe the file STRUCTURES, including those defined to hold the new data types, and the details of how to build a LAS ver 3.0 file.

The next part of the LAS 3.0 release will describe specific CONTENT requirements. These content requirements will describe the exact sections, parameters, and channels that will satisfy the specific needs of each group or organization that wishes to define a LAS 3.0 content requirements.

To introduce the new structure concepts, remember that in previous versions of LAS the following sections were required: **~Version**, **~Well**, **~Curve** and **~ASCII**. The **~Version** section contains only data related to the LAS file. This section is still required in LAS 3.0, and now has additional options added. The **~Well** section contains all data that is common to every data set related to that specific well, including the well identification and location. This section has been maintained and expanded.

The remaining sections in an LAS file will be defined by the data set or sets being included. In general terms they will follow the pattern of a Parameter section, Definition section, and a Data section for each data set. This is consistent with the historical **~Parameter**, **~Curve** and **~ASCII** sections used for log data. While these section names have been maintained for log data, the equivalent sections for new data sets will follow this new naming convention:

#### **~Section_Parameter, ~Section_Definition, and ~Section_Data.**

Some data sets will require all three of these section, others may only require a Parameter section, or a combination of Definition and Data sections.

A LAS 3.0 file might contain just one data set, such as logs or core, or it could contain a number of data sets. Whichever option is chosen, there must only be one ~Version section, and one ~Well section. These sections must also be the first two sections in the file, and in this order. After that, each data set should appear as a set. For example, the **~Parameter**, **~Curve**, and **~ASCII** sections must appear together. Likewise **~Core_Parameter**, **~Core_Definition**, and **~Core_Data** must appear together.

The future has been designed into the new version of LAS. Using the following two data models, provision has been made to allow users to define new sections as the need arises. These new sections should fit either of the following cases:

1) Self-contained Sections, such as the **~Well** Information and **~Parameter** sections. (Note: In most cases the **~Parameter** sections are related to other data sections.) Following this example, the new section would look something like this:

### **~NewSection_Parameter**

**Name .***Unit**Data* **: Description {F} | Association**

2) Data Sections with related Definition and optional Parameter sections. These sections will follow the **~Parameter**, **~Curve**, **~ASCII** model where **~Parameter**s contains header information related to the log data, **~Curve** contains the definitions of the log curves present, and **~ASCII** contains an indexed table of log digits.

```
~NewSection_Parameter
```

| Data | : Description | {F}   Association |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
|      |               |                   |

**~NewSection_Data | NewSection_Definition**

**1234.00,5678.00 1234.25,6789.00 1234.50,7890.00**

The Parameter sections are optional, and should only be used for data that is directly relevant to the type of data intended for that section.

In all cases, user-defined sections must follow the same structure rules set out for the defined sections in this document.

# **What's new in LAS Ver 3.0**

This is a short list of the new features in Ver 3.0

- 1. New Data types. (Core, Drilling etc).
- 2. "Structure" rules separated from "Content" rules.
- 3. New delimiters and structures.
- 4. Comma Tab and Space delimited data.
- 5. Handles 1D, 2D and 3D arrays
- 6. Supports Multiple Runs.
- 7. Parameter Zoning.
- 8. Floating point, string, integer, Date and Time formats supported.
- 9. Addition of User defined data is easy
- 10. WRAP YES has been dropped.
- 11. ~Other section has been dropped.

# **Major Components of a LAS Ver 3.0 File**

LAS Files are divided into logical sections. Sections are recognized by lines that begin with the ~ (tilde, ASCII 126) character. These section defining lines are called **Section Title lines**. Specific sections are recognized by their names, which follow the ~(tilde) character. The entire word following the ~ is the section name, not just the first character after the ~.

Sections contain lines where data is described and/or stored. There are several types of sections and several types of lines within sections.

The LAS 3.0 standard defines which combinations of sections must exist in LAS files, and in which order. For example, the **~Version** and **~Well** section must exist in that order in all Ver 3.0 LAS files.

As in LAS version 2.0, only one well will be described within a single file.

Data is stored as one, two or three dimensional arrays. The data are usually indexed to depth or time, but may be presented as discrete measurements if required.

Data is grouped by type into related sections, as they relate to the well in which that data was acquired. Types include depth and time indexed Logging, Core, Inclinometry, Drilling, Formation tops, test data, user defined types, etc.

### **Primary Section Types**

### **Parameter Data Sections**

Contains any number of **Parameter Data** lines (see below). Intended to hold One dimensional data that relates in general to one of the data types described.

### **Column Definition Sections**

Contains any number of **Column Definition** lines (see below). Intended to hold detailed descriptions (name, unit, etc) of each 2D or 3D channels stored in a **Column Data** section. There is always a matching **Column Data** section.

### **Column Data Sections**

Contains any number of **Column Data** lines (see below). Intended to hold 2D and 3D indexed and non-indexed channels. There is always a matching **Column Definition** section that fully describes each channel. There may also be a matching **Parameter Data** section that holds related parameters.

### **User Defined Sections**

Other types of sections can be defined as the user needs. Always use the above three primary types whenever possible. See the section on **Adding User Defined Data** for additional details.

### **Lines Types Within Sections**

### **Parameter Data Lines**

Appear in **Parameter Data** sections.

Each **Parameter Data** line contains a one dimensional data item consisting of (usually but not restricted to) one or two elements. Each line also contains a full description of that data.

Some **Parameter Data** lines are required in certain sections. Some of these required **Parameter Data** lines must also contain data, while other do not. Later sections discussing specific sections will state specific requirements.

Note: Required implies the **Parameter Data** line for each listed item must exist, consisting of the Mnemonic, unit (if applicable), and description. The **Value** field for each required **Parameter Data** line does not have to filled in for LAS compliance. The exception to this rule It is strongly recommended that

### **Column Definition Lines**

Appear only in **Column Definition** sections.

Although structurally identical to a **Parameter Data** lines (see above), each **Column Definition** line is used to describe each matching (by order) channel contained in the matching **Column Data** section. The name, unit, log code, description and format (if used) contained in each **Column Definition** line fully describe the channel it refers to.

### **Column Data Lines**

Appear only in **Column Data** sections.

Each line contains a series of delimited data values. The delimiting character is defined by the value of the **DLM** parameter in the **~Version** section. Descriptions of each data are contained in the matching **Column Definition** section.

### **Structure Details**

The details of the sections and the lines within the sections are discussed.

### **Sections**

The **~Version** and **~Well** sections must appear in every LAS 3.0 file as the first and second sections respectively.

Other sections are grouped by data type. Each group consists of two or three sections; a **Parameter Data** section (optional for all but Log data), a **Column Definition** section, and a **Column Data** section, in that order.

For example, core analysis data would have the following three sections:

```
~Core_Parameter
~Core_Definition
~Core_Data.
```
At least one group or data type of either the defined LAS 3.0 data types or a user defined type must exist in every LAS 3.0 file.

The **Column Definition** and the **Column Data** sections for each data type are matched sets and must both appear in that order. The corresponding **Parameter Data** section is optional (except for Log data), but if used must appear before it's corresponding **Column Definition** Section.

LAS 3.0 defines six specific well related data types and their root Section Title names. They are:

```
~Ascii or ~Log
~Core
~Inclinometry
~Drilling
~Tops
~Test
```
Additional data types can be defined by the user and content rules discussed elsewhere in the document may define other section titles.

Stand alone user defined **Parameter Data** sections can be included. Care must be taken to use standalone **Parameter Data** sections only when the data contained does not fit into any of the other defined data types.

When used, the section order of each set of the three sections for each data type must be Parameter, Definition, then Data.

Blank lines and comment lines can appear within **Column Data** sections, but can only appear BEFORE the first **Column Data** line of that section, or after the LAST **Column Data** line of that section.

The names of each channel can optionally appear above each channel as a comment line immediately before, after or on the section title line of that section if space allows.

**Note:** Do not use the **~Other** section recognized by LAS ver 2.0. It is no longer allowed in LAS 3.0. Any data that can be stored in such a section, must now be stored properly in a user defined **Parameter Data** or **Column Data** section.

### **Lines Within Sections**

### **Section Title Lines**

First non-space character of the line must the ~ (tilde, ASCII 126) character.

The identifying **Section Title** is all characters from the first character after the ~ (tilde) until the next space, the next | (bar) character, or the end of that line.

**Parameter Data** section titles must be named by appending the suffix **_Parameter** to the root **Section Title** such as **~Core_Parameter.**

**Column Definition** section titles must be named by appending the suffix **_Definition** to the root **Section Title** such as **~Core_Definition.**

**Column Data** section titles must be named by appending the suffix **_Data** to the root **Section Title** such as **~Core_Data.**

Sections that are exceptions to the required suffix additions are the **~Parameter, ~Curve** and **~ASCII** sections, which implies logging data.

The **Column Data Section Title** line must include an association to its matching **Column Definition** section.

Do this by first placing a | (bar, ASCII 124) character after the **Section Title**, then adding the full matching **Column Definition** section title (without the ~ tilde), such as;

**~Core_Data | Core_Definition**

This gives a reliable way of knowing which **Column Definition** section belongs with this **Column Data** section.

**Note:** No other section title lines other than a Data Section title line may use the association delimiter (|) followed by other section titles.

The **Section Title line** must contain at least the ~ (tilde) and a section title. The character immediately after the ~ (tilde) must not be a space, i.e. the section title must begin immediately after the ~ (tilde).

If the bar character and matching **Column Definition** section title are included, then that matching **Column Definition** section must exist in the LAS file.

Any number of spaces can separate the section title and | (bar) delimiter and the matching **Column Definition** section title.

### **Parameter Data Lines**

Each **Parameter Data** line consists of at least four, and up to six delimited fields. Each field has a defined name. Some fields may only contain spaces if not needed (such as Unit).

**MNEM.UNIT VALUE : DESCRIPTION {Format} | Assoc1,Assoc2 …**

Delimiting characters and the following rules are used to separate the fields. Full descriptions of the delimiters can be found in Appendix II.

Each section should have the first period and last colon, and all other delimiting characters and fields aligned for each of reading, but this is not a requirement, nor is having the same alignment of the delimiters in all sections.

Note: Do not use TAB characters on a **Parameter Data** line in an attempt to space out the items. Use Spaces only for this purpose. Tabs are reserved for use as delimiting characters, and may only be used on **Parameter Data** lines as delimiters between multiple **Value** field data items or to delimit **Association** Parameters.

### **MNEMONIC** (MNEM)

Any length >0, but must not contain periods, colons, embedded spaces, tabs, { }. [ ], | (bar) characters, leading or trailing spaces are ignored. It ends at (but does not include) the first period encountered on the line.

**UNIT** (if data has a unit)

Any length, but must not contain colons, embedded spaces, tabs, {} or | characters. If present, it must begin at the next character after the first period on the line. The Unit ends at (but does not include) the first space or first colon after the first period on the line.

**VALUE** (may be required or optional)

Any length, but must not contain colons, {} or | characters. If the Unit field is present, at least one space must exist between the unit and the first character of the **Value** field. The **Value** field ends at (but does not include) the last colon on the line.

The **Value** field can contain more than one piece of data. Each piece must be delimited by the character defined in the **DLM** (Data Delimiting Character) parameter in the **~Version** section.

Individual data items that themselves contain the delimiting character, must each be entirely surrounded by a single pair of quotes " " (ASCII 34 each). No data item can contain a pair of double quote characters "" (ASCII 34 twice).

### **DESCRIPTION**

Any length. Begins as the first character after the last colon on the line, and ends at the last { (left brace), or the last | (bar), or the end of the line, whichever is encountered first.

### **FORMAT** (optional)

Contained within the last set of matching {} (left and right braces). If you do not want to specify a format, then do not use a matched set of {} within the DESCRIPTION field or an error may result if the characters within the {} are not proper format characters.

If the format field is absent, this implies that any numerical data referred to by this line must be in floating point format.

### **ASSOCIATION(s)** (optional)

The Associations field contains one or more mnemonics found elsewhere in the LAS file on **Parameter Data** or **Column Definition** lines. Those lines hold related pieces of information to the data found on this line.

Association mnemonics are listed after the last | (bar) character on the line, delimited by the **DLM** character for multiple mnemonics. Each Association mnemonic used must be found somewhere else in the LAS file as a legal mnemonic on a **Parameter Data** line or **Column Definition** line.

**Column Data** section lines and comments cannot contain associated parameters.

### **Column Definition Lines**

**Column Definition** Lines are identical in structure to **Parameter Data** lines and share all rules discussed for **Parameter Data** lines. They do not carry data, rather they fully describe each data channel in the matching **Column Data** section elsewhere in the file. The order is most critical and must be the same as the order of the columns of data in the referenced **Column Data** section.

### **Column Data Lines**

**Column Data** lines contain delimited data values on each line of a **Column Data** section.

**Column Data** Lines can be of any length and contain any number of data items. If the **Column Definition** for any data item has a format { } specified (Floating point, integer, etc), then all data items must be formatted using that specified format.

Each line must contain the same number of delimiting characters, which is one less than the number of data items. The number of data items must match the number of **Column Definition** lines found in the matching **Column Definition** section.

Each column of data must be separated by exactly one delimiting character specified in the **Value** field of the **DLM** parameter found in the **~Version** section. If the delimiter is the SPACE character, then continuous space characters are to be taken as a single delimiter.

Comma and Tab delimited files only: Data items may be absent at any level, as indicated by two consecutive delimiter characters. The value of this missing data item must be taken as the NULL value described in the **~Well** section by the NULL parameter. For space delimited files, data items cannot be absent. The NULL value must be used.

Data items that themselves contain the delimiting character, must each be entirely surrounded by a single pair of quotes " " (ASCII 34 each). No data item can contain a pair of double quote characters "" (ASCII 34 twice).

Cases where two or more consecutive delimiters (except space delimiters) occur, the missing data channel inferred between each delimiter shall be interpreted as the NULL value as defined in the **~Well** section Null parameter.

**1000.00,13.45,46.0985,,,**

is equivalent to

**1000.00,13.45,46.0985,-999.25, -999.25, -999.25**

If a **Column Data** line has an indexed channel as the first channel, then that first data item cannot be blank or null, regardless of the delimiting character.

# **Individual Section Descriptions**

### **Required sections**

**~Version**

The **~Version** section identifies information pertaining the file itself.

The **~Version** section must be the first section of every LAS 3.0 file. It is classified as a **Parameter Data** section, and must conform to the basic rules that apply to all **Parameter Data** sections.

**VERS, WRAP** and **DLM** must be the first **Parameter Data** lines of the section. All other **Parameter Data** lines must contain data that relates to the LAS standard or the file itself, never to the well. Well related information must be placed in other appropriate sections.

No association mnemonics are allowed. Comment lines and blank lines are allowed.

Any other **Parameter Data** lines as defined by user need or future standards compliance definitions may also be present, but must come AFTER the three required parameters.

# **Required Contents (All files)**

Three **Parameter Data** lines are required. The **Value** field of each must contain one of the indicated or optional values.

|          | VERS. |       | 3.0 : LAS Version Identifier    |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|
|          | WRAP. |       | No : WRAP mode                  |
| OR<br>OR | DLM . | SPACE | : Column Data Section Delimiter |
|          | DLM . | COMMA | : Column Data Section Delimiter |
|          | DLM . | TAB   | : Column Data Section Delimiter |

The delimiting characters referred to by the **SPACE**, **Comma** and **Tab** words are ASCII 32 for **Space**, ASCII 44 for **Comma** and ASCII 9 for **Tab**.

**Note:** if the **DLM Value** field has no value, then Space delimiting is assumed by default.

# **Details Specific to the ~Version section**

**Column Data** sections no longer have line length restrictions. This removes the need to define a way to write multiple lines for each index step, as previously defined in LAS ver 2.0 using the WRAP YES parameter. **NO** is the only legal LAS 3.0 value for WRAP.

The **Value** used for **DLM** must be one of the three possible words listed above. Never use the actual ASCII characters described by the words for the **Value** field.

All **Column Data, Parameter Data,** and **Column Definition** sections in the LAS file must use the same and actual ASCII character (not the word) as described by **DLM**'s value for delimiting data.

Each single delimiter character represents the division between each successive column of any **Column Data** section or **Value** field on a **Parameter Data** line. The only exception to this is the SPACE delimiter, where consecutive space characters are considered one delimiter.

If the delimiter is Tab or Comma, then the number of delimiter characters for every index step must be exactly one less than the number of channels being included. If the delimiter is space, then at least one space delimiter must exist between each column at all index levels.

Cases where two or more consecutive delimiters (except space delimiters) occur, the missing data channel inferred between each delimiter shall be interpreted as the NULL value as defined by the **Null** parameter's **value** field found in the **~Well** section.

**1000.00,13.45,46.0985,,,**

is equivalent to

**1000.00,13.45,46.0985,-999.25, -999.25, -999.25**

If a **Column Data** line has an index (first) channel, then that channel cannot be left empty.

### **~Well**

The **~Well** section contains data that uniquely identifies the Well bore data.

### **Required Contents (All files)**

The following eleven **Parameter Data** lines are required in every **~Well** section. The **Value** field of the **STRT, STOP, STEP** and **NULL** parameters must contain data. All other **Value** fields are not required to contain data but it is strongly recommended that all **Parameter Data** lines contain correct data.

**STRT, STOP** and **STEP value** fields must contain the actual first, last and increment values of the index channel in the **~ASCII** or the **~Log_Data** section (if present, and if there is only one **~Log_Data** section).

If the file contains more than one **~Log_Data** section, then the **STRT, STOP** and **STEP** value fields must have the correct data for **~Log_Data[1]**. Other sections **~Log_Data[n]** sections do not require additional **STRT, STOP** and **STEP** parameters at this time.

STEP must be 0 if step increment is not exactly constant between every index.

| STRT . | Value | : First Index Value |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| STOP . | Value | : Last Index Value  |
| STEP . | Value | : STEP of index     |

The **NULL** value requires a value. –999.25 or –99999 are common examples.

| NULL . | Value |  | : NULL VALUE |
|--------|-------|--|--------------|
|        |       |  |              |

The Well identification, location and ownership parameters are as follows;

| COMP . |  | : Company         |
|--------|--|-------------------|
| WELL . |  | : Well            |
| FLD .  |  | : Field           |
| LOC .  |  | : Location        |
| SRVC . |  | : Service Company |
| CTRY . |  | : Country         |

**CTRY** value must be a valid internet country code.

**DATE . : Service Date**

X/Y location co-ordinate parameters are required. The **Value** fields are optional. There are two possible sets of parameters which must be used. Either set is acceptable, but each set must be complete.

|                            | (Either) |                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LATI .<br>LONG .<br>GDAT . |          | : Latitude<br>: Longitude<br>: Geodetic Datum                                                                       |
|                            | (OR)     |                                                                                                                     |
| X<br>Y<br>GDAT .<br>HZCS . |          | : X or East-West coordinate<br>: Y or North South coordinate<br>: Geodetic Datum<br>: Horizontal Co-ordinate System |

If Country (CTRY) has the value of **ca**, (Canada) then these three **Parameter Data** lines must be included.

| PROV . |  | : Province       |
|--------|--|------------------|
| UWI .  |  | : UNIQUE WELL ID |
| LIC .  |  | : License Number |

If Country (CTRY) has the value of **us**, (USA), then these three **Parameter Data** lines must be included.

| STAT . |  | : State      |
|--------|--|--------------|
| CNTY . |  | : County     |
| API .  |  | : API NUMBER |

If Country (CTRY) has the no **Value**, then neither of these sets is required. The user can add similar data applicable to the country in use.

### **Details Specific to the ~Well Section**

No associations are allowed for any defined mnemonic in the **~Well** section.

**~Well** must be the second section of every LAS 3.0 file. It may contain only **Parameter Data** lines, comments and blank lines. Any user added **Parameter Data** lines must come after all defined or required lines.

The **STRT**, **STOP** and **STEP** parameter data lines must always appear as the first three lines of the **~Well** section.

The **STRT** value must be exactly that of the FIRST index value (first column) in the **~ASCII** section or **~Log_Data** section.

The **STOP** value must be exactly that of the LAST index value (first column) in the **~ASCII** section or **~Log_Data** section.

The **STOP** parameter can have a value of NULL ( the same value as listed as the value of the **NULL** Parameter). This is necessary to accommodate an emerging need of real time data acquisition where data files are being constantly updated. See Appendix V on Real time Data Allowances for details. This rule only applies if the **~ASCII** section is used for Log data.

The **STEP** value must be the exact value of the difference between every index value of the first channel of the **~ASCII** section or **~Log_Data** section. Where the **STEP** increment is not a constant difference between successive index values, the **STEP** must be have the value of zero.

An excellent source of Geodetic datum and Horizontal Coordinate System parameter values (**GDAT** and **HZCS)** is the EPSG database of geodetic information Check: **http://www.petroconsultants.com/products/geodetic.html** for further details.

The **CTRY** parameter value, if present, must be one of the two letter Internet country codes appropriate to the country in which the well is located. Check:

**http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/wwwstat/country-codes.txt**

or search the internet for "Country Codes". Several sources are available.

If **CTRY** has is a value other than **ca** or **us,** then neither of the above indicated **Parameter Data** line sets or any other additional parameters are required.

The **DATE** value format must either be specified in a format field on that line, or the {DD/MM/YYYY} format will be taken as the default

### **Data Section Sets**

Each of the following six defined data type section sets are optional, but at least one set must exist in each LAS 3.0 file. The **Parameter Data** section of each set is optional except the **~Parameter** or **~Log_Parameter** sections if Log data is present.

#### **Log Data Section(s)**

Log data is defined and stored in the **~Parameter, ~Curve**, and **~ASCII** sections (for those who wish to continue with Ver 2.0 guidelines) **or** in complete sets of **~Log_Parameter, ~Log_Definition** and **~Log_Data** sections.

If Log data is stored in a LAS 3.0 file and the file contains only the **~ASCII** section (no **~Log_Data** sections), then the **~ASCII** section must the last section of the file.

If Log data is stored in a LAS 3.0 file and the file contains only a single **~Log_Data** section (no **~ASCII** section), then the **~Log_Data** section must the last section of the file.

If Log data is stored in a LAS 3.0 file and the file contains more than one **~Log_Data** section, then all **~Log_Data[n]** sections must the last sections of the file.

**~Parameter, ~Curve and ~ASCII** as well as **~Log_Parameter, ~Log_Definition** and **~Log_Data** are reserved LAS Ver 3.0 section names. Only the **~Log_Parameter, ~Log_Definition** and **~Log_Data** sections can have multiple sections in the same file. (**~Log_Data[n]** etc). **~Parameter, ~Curve and ~ASCII** section titles must not use [n] index suffixes.

#### **~Parameter or ~Log_Parameter**

The **~Parameter** or **~Log_Parameter** sections are the **Parameter Data** sections that corresponds to Log Parameters. All rules that apply to **Parameter Data** sections apply to these sections.

The **Section Title line** must look exactly like these options with possible [n] suffix as appropriate for multiple **~Log_Parameter** sections.

**~Parameter ~Log_Parameter ~Log_Parameter[n]**

The parameters associated with each group of logging data are listed in the **~Parameter** or **~Log_Parameter** sections. An example of the section contents might look like this.

| PDAT . |            | : Permanent Data               |
|--------|------------|--------------------------------|
|        | APD .Unit  | : Above Permanent Data         |
| DREF . |            | : Depth Reference (KB,DF,CB)   |
|        | EREF .Unit | : Elevation of Depth Reference |
| RUN .  |            | : Run Number                   |

### **~Curve or ~Log_Definition**

The **~Curve** or **~Log_Definition** sections are the **Column Definition** sections that corresponds to Log Definitions. All rules that apply to **Column Definition** sections apply to these sections.

These sections holds the **Column Definition**s for each of the data items in the **~ASCII** or **~Log_Data** sections. The **Section Title line**s must look exactly like these options with possible [n] suffix as appropriate for multiple **~Log_Definition** sections.

**~Curve ~Log_Definition ~Log_Definition[n]**

An example of the section contents might look like this.

| DEPT.FT   | Log Code : DEPTH                |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| DPHI.PU   | Log Code : DENSITY POROSITY     |
| GR .GAP   | Log Code : GAMMA RAY            |
| PEF .     | Log Code : PHOTOELECTRIC FACTOR |
| RHOB.G/C3 | Log Code : BULK DENSITY         |
|           |                                 |

### **~ASCII or ~Log_Data**

The **~ ASCII** or **~Log_Data** sections are the **Column Data** sections that corresponds to Log data. All rules that apply to **Column Data** sections apply to these sections. They hold the indexed log data values. The **Section Title line**s must look exactly like these with possible [n] suffix as appropriate for multiple **~Log_Data** sections.

**~ASCII | Curve ~Log_Data | ~Log_Definition ~Log_Data[n] | ~Log_Definition[n]**

The | (bar) delimiter must be used with the ~Log_Data section to comply with the new **Column Data** section title association rules. The association section title can be left off of the **~ASCII** section title. The **~Curve** section is then assumed to be the matching **Column Definition** section.

An example of the section contents might look like this.

**3264.50000 -5.65000 146.25214 3.34967 2.74322** or **3264.50000,-5.65000,146.25214,3.34967,2.74322**

The first channel of the **~ASCII** or **~Log_Data** section must be the index of the other channels. The index channel must be continuously increasing or decreasing.

#### **Core Data Sections**

Three new sections are designed to hold Core data.

**~Core_Data, ~Core_Definition ~Core_Parameter** are reserved LAS Ver 3.0 section names. Multiple sections can have Index extensions to each of the three sections ([1], [2] etc)

These sections are not mandatory. If any are present, then all must be present.

### **~Core_Parameter**

The **~Core_Parameter** section is a **Parameter Data** section. All rules that apply to **Parameter Data** sections apply to this section.

The parameters associated with each group of core data are listed in the **~Core_Parameter** section. An example would look like this.

| C_SRS . |       | : Core Source                       | {S} |
|---------|-------|-------------------------------------|-----|
| C_TY    |       | : Core Type                         | {S} |
| C_DT    |       | : Recovery Date (Date Core Cut) {D} |     |
| C_TP    | .Unit | : Core Top Depth                    | {F} |
| C_BS    | .Unit | : Core Base Depth                   | {F} |
| C_RC    | .Unit | : Recovered Amount (Length)         | {F} |
| C_FM    |       | : Primary Formation Cored           | {S} |
| C_DI    | .Unit | : Core Diameter                     | {F} |
| C_AC    |       | : Analyzing Company                 | {S} |
| C_AD    |       | : Analysis Date                     | {D} |

### **~Core_Definition**

The **~Core_Definition** section is a **Column Definition** section. This section holds the **Column Definition**s for each of the data items in the **~Core_Data** section. The **Section Title line** must look exactly like this with possible [n] suffix as appropriate for multiple sections.

#### **~Core_Definition**

An example of the section contents might look like this.

|        | CORT .Unit  | : Core Top depth            | {F} |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----|
|        | CORB .Unit  | : Core Bottom Depth         | {F} |
|        | PERM .Unit  | : Core permeability         | {F} |

# **LAS 3.0 Data Formats**

LAS version 2 only allowed the use of floating point number format for data stored in the **~ASCII** section. Data stored in the **Value** field of any **Parameter Data** line was allowed to be either a floating point number or a string of text.

**BS .***unit* **8.25 : Bit Size LMF. Kelly Bushing : Log Measured From**

Ver 3.0 allows six formats types; **Floating point**, **Integer**, **Exponential**, **String**, **Date and Time, Deg/min/sec**

The optional (for floating point and String data types) format specification is placed inside a matched set of {} braces, that are placed after the DESCRIPTION field and before the ASSOCIATION | (bar) delimiter (if present) on any **Parameter Data** line or **Column Definition** line.

The format specification that appears on each line either refers to the data value on that line for **Parameter Data** lines, or to all data items of the corresponding channel in the **Column Data** section for **Column Definition** lines.

If no format field is included, then the old floating point rules apply for **Column Data** section channels. For **Parameter Data** lines, the absence of the format specification implies either String or Floating point format, depending on the value that is present. Typically an absence of units implies a string value, while the presence of units implies floating point. Since this is not a conclusive rule, the use of the format {} field on **Parameter Data** lines is strongly recommended, and required when formats other than String or Floating point are used.

The only exception to this rule is the format of the required **DATE** parameter in the **~Well** section. If the format specification is absent, the format of the date must be **{DD/MM/YYYY}**.

The format specification must contain no embedded spaces. The only exception is if a format contains both a date and time specification such as {DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm}. Then a single space can be used between the date and time format.

### **Floating Point {Fx.y}**

The floating point format begins with the F as the first character after the { (left brace). The optional x.y value is an decimal number > 0 that expresses the total length of the floating point number, and the number of decimals. x is the total length, while y is the number of decimal places. x must be at least equal to y+2 to be a valid format. The x.y value is optional, although if used then both x and y must appear.

If no specific format is used, then every data value must have at least one decimal place. It is customary that every number for this channel has the same number of decimals, even if padding zeros must be added.

If the number being presented has fewer digits than the format, then padding spaces are appended BEFORE the number. (- dash characters are used to show space characters in the examples)

**12.4567 expressed with a format of: {F10.4} ---12.4567**

If the number of decimal places in the format is more than the number has, then padding zero's are added to the end of the number.

**12.45 expressed with a format of: {F10.4} ---12.4500**

If the number of decimal places in the format is less than the number has, then the number is rounded to the specified number of decimals.

```
12.456 expressed with a format of: {F10.2} -----12.46
```
**Integer {Ix}**

The Integer format begins with the I as the first character after the { (left brace). The optional x value is an integer >0 that expresses the total length of the integer number. If x is specified, then ALL data items must be written using this number of characters, even if padding spaces must be added. If the x value is not specified, then Integer can be of any length. Valid examples are **{I2}** or **{I10}.**

### **String {Sx}**

The string format begins with the S as the first character after the { (left brace). This implies that the data it refers to is to interpreted as text. The optional x value is an integer >0 that expresses the total length of the string. If x is specified, then ALL data items must be written using this number of characters, even if padding spaces must be added, or extra characters removed. If the x value is not specified, then each text string can be of any length. Valid examples are **{S}** or **{S32}.**

### **Exponential {E0.00E+00}**

The exponential format begins with the E as the first character after the { (left brace). The remainder of the format is the standard exponential format. The + (plus) indicates the placeholder for the sign (which may be + or – for any particular number) of the exponent. The number of zero's is not restricted in any part of the format. All numbers of the channel must be written with exactly this format. Leading padding spaces can be added as required.

| Number  | Format     | Number using format |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| 1230000 | 0.00E+00   | 1.23E+07            |
| 1230000 | 00.000E+00 | 12.345E+07          |

### **Date and Time {DD/MMM/YYYY hh:mm:ss}**

The Date and time format uses ISO 8601 standards. The format includes both Dates (upper case letters) and Time (lower case letters) formats. Either can be used without the other, or both together.

### **Date**

The Date format uses upper case D for days, upper case M for months, and upper case Y for years. The number of each of these letters determines the exact format.

| D –  | Day number expressed as single digit (1-9) or 2 digit (10-31) |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| DD – | Day number expressed as 2 digit (01-31)                       |

| M –    | Month expressed as single digit (1-9) or 2 digit (10-12)    |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| MM –   | Month expressed as two number code (01 - 12)                |
| MMM –  | Month expressed as three character month word (JAN FEB etc) |
| MMMM - | Month expressed as full month word (January, etc)           |

YYYY – Year expressed as full 4 digit year. This is the only year format acceptable for LAS 3.0

The delimiters can be – (dash ASCII 45) or / ( forward slash ASCII 47). No spaces are allowed within the date format.

### **Time**

The Time Format uses lower case letter, h for hours, m for minutes, and s for seconds. This is the only occurrence of case sensitivity in LAS 3.0

| hh – | Two digit hours, (00-24)   |
|------|----------------------------|
| mm – | two digit minutes, (00-59) |
| ss – | two digit seconds (00-59)  |

The delimiters between hours minutes and sections can only be the : (colon). No spaces are allowed within the time format.

*LAS 3.0 File Structure Specifications -- Page #* 24 The Time format can be hh, hh:mm or hh:mm:ss

The Date and time format (if both are used) must be separated by at least one space

### **Degree Minute Seconds {° ' "}**

The format for Latitude and Longitude type may be expressed using the degree, minute and second symbols as shown in this example.

**23.45° 34.06' 58.19"**

The three special symbols ° **(**ASCII 176) degree, **'** (ASCII 39) single quote, and **"** (ASCII 34) double quotes. All three must be used when using this format.

Alternately, simple decimal degrees is also accepted. This would represented by the floating point format **{F}**.

# **Three Dimension Data Arrays in Column Data sections**

Three dimensional arrays don't naturally fit into a decidedly two dimensional ASCII file. The data in the third dimension often has another index or reference than the data in the other dimension.

LAS 3.0 provides a way to define this third dimension.

Consider an example of an **~ASCII** section containing the usual two dimensional data, in this example with two data channels measured at each depth. They are differentiated here with different font.

**~ASCII** Chan1 **Chan2 1000.0** 1.23 **222.45 1001.0** 1.56 **245.09 1002.0** 3.45 **257.81**

Consider the case where CHAN1 was measured five times will the logging sensor was stationary at each depth level. These five measurements are the data items in the third dimension, with in this case, an index of TIME.

The first dimension is depth (the first column). The second dimension is the time index of each data sample at that depth, and the third dimension is each of the measurements of each channel while at that one depth at each time step.

LAS 3.0 defines a convention that allows three dimensional data to be stored as two dimensional data.

In our example where CHAN1 had five different measurements taken while stopped at each of the depths (first column), the five measurements are just listed as additional channels next to the first.

The CHAN1 data value (1.23) is the first measurement that you expect for each channel, and the other four remaining channels are the remaining measurements taken in time while at each depth. The other data channel, **CHAN2,** just falls normally after the five three dimensional array values of CHAN1 channels.

|        | ~ASCII Chan1 Chan1 Chan1 Chan1 Chan1 |      |      |      |      | Chan2  |
|--------|--------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1000.0 | 1.23                                 | 1.24 | 1.25 | 1.24 | 1.20 | 222.45 |
| 1001.0 | 1.56                                 | 1.57 | 1.58 | 1.59 | 1.55 | 245.09 |
| 1002.0 | 3.45                                 | 3.24 | 3.25 | 3.24 | 3.20 | 257.81 |

The **Column Definition** section for this **Column Data** section is used to indicate which channels are members of the 3D array, and which are regular 2D components. We just add additional information to each line of the array channels in the **Column Definition** section that determines which channels are members of a 3D array.

This additional information needs to record to pieces of information;

- 1. This channel is a member of a 3D array.
- 2. The index and spacing for this channel. Each sample may be distributed with time, or distance, or rotational angle, or may just be a non-indexed list.

Rather than introducing a new indicator, the Format field **{}** is used. We use a special Format character, **A**, to indicate that a channel is a member of an array. If a regular format character (**F, I, S E** or **Dates/Time**) is also needed, then add the Format specification immediately after the **A**, like **{AF10.4}**. The **A** must always be the first character in the format specification if it is used.

The index or spacing of each array member may also be recorded within the format specification. Use the **;** (semicolon) delimiter to list the spacing and its units, after the **A** and the format specification, like this;

### **{AF10.4;5ms}**

This says that this array element is spaced 5 milliseconds after the first array element. Additional indexes are possible. Just add another ; (semicolon), then the next index, like **{AF10.4;5ms;10ft}**.

Each channel's name is the same for each member of the array, as each array member is the same channel. To indicate the difference, each name has the **[ ]** index suffix appended with the sequential index number within the brackets..

| CHAN[1].Unit | : Description {AF10.4;0ms}  |  |
|--------------|-----------------------------|--|
| CHAN[2].Unit | : Description {AF10.4;5ms}  |  |
| CHAN[3].Unit | : Description {AF10.4;10ms} |  |
| CHAN[4].Unit | : Description {AF10.4;15ms} |  |
| CHAN[5].Unit | : Description {AF10.4;20ms} |  |

This **[ ]** marker is not part of the channel name. It is another way of saying this channel is a member of an array. The number in the **[ ]** indicates the counter of the array that it is part of.

Channels that are members of a 3D array, must occur sequentially from **[1]** to **[n]**, with no other channels intermixed. Different sets of 3D array channels can occur before, mixed with or after regular two dimensional data channels, but each set must be continuous within itself.

### **Section Title Arrays**

It is now possible to have more than one of any ~ (tilde) section, with the exception of the **~Version, ~Well, ~Parameter**, **~Curve** and **~Ascii** sections.

To have more than one section with the same section title as another section, each section title must be suffixed with the array index brackets, [], containing a sequential number, beginning with 1.

**~Log_Data**[1] **| Log_Definition ~Log_Data**[2] **| Log_Definition**

Note that in this case, both **Column Data** sections share the same **Column Definition** section. This just means that they have the same type of data in each column. There is no need to have one **Column Data** sections for every **Column Definition** section if the data contained in each column are indeed identical in all **Column Data** sections.

If they had any difference in column order, name, units, formats etc, then each would need their own **Column Definition** section. In this case, each **Column Definition** section would also need [] index suffixes.

```
~Log_Data[1] | Log_Definition[1]
~Log_Data[2] | Log_Definition[2]
```
If there are matching **Parameter Data** sections for each **Column Data** section, then they too must get the same [x] index suffix.

```
~Log_Parameter[1]
~Log_Parameter[2]
```
(Note that for Log or ASCII data section, **Parameter Data** sections are required)

These rules apply to any section title (with the above exceptions).

### **Parameter Data Line Arrays**

If you have two identical mnemonics in the same **Parameter Data** section, then you have two choices.

- 1. Add different association parameters, such as for run differentiation if this is the reason for having multiple occurrences.
- **BS .***UNIT* **8.75 : BIT SIZE | RUN**[1] **BS .***UNIT* **6.25 : BIT SIZE | RUN**[2]
- 2. Add sequential index suffixes **[n]** to each. The association parameters are then optional, and should be used if appropriate to the application.

**BS**[1] **.***UNIT* **8.75 : BIT SIZE | RUN**[1] **BS**[2] **.***UNIT* **6.25 : BIT SIZE | RUN**[2]

See the section on **Association in LAS 3.0** for further examples and details of these techniques.

Index numbers must begin with 1 and must be sequential. They do not have to appear sequentially in the file however.

### **Associations in LAS 3.0**

LAS 3.0 defines several association arrangements to handle the following types of situations. Associations allow you to connect one piece of data to another.

Often one piece of information in a LAS file is directly related to another piece of data. A common example is the matrix density value (SAND, LIME or DOLO density) which was used to convert Bulk Density data to Density Porosity. To connect the two, we simply add the related mnemonic to the end of the **Parameter Data** or **Column Definition** line (after a new delimiter) that relates to it.

Parameter line found in **~Parameter** section

**MDEN .K/M3 2650 : Matrix Density**

Channel definition line in **~Curve** section, that depends on **MDEN**

**DPHI .V/V Log Code : Density Porosity | MDEN**

In any case, you must never specify a circular set of associations. That is, the association mnemonic used on one **Parameter Data** line, must not have as its association parameter, the mnemonic found on that line. Below **MDEN** points to DPHI and DPHI points to **MDEN**!

**Wrong!**

MDEN **.K/M3 2650 : Matrix Density | DPHI**

**DPHI .V/V Log Code : Density Porosity |** MDEN

The following examples are only guidelines of what can be accomplished with Associations. It is expected many other uses will be found.

Note that several of the parameter mnemonics used in the examples are now reserved LAS 3.0 mnemonics which are intended to be used as shown in these examples. See Appendix II.

#### **Example 1. Storing Multiple Runs**

To indicate multiple sets of any **Parameter Data** section parameters that may have come from more than one logging run, LAS 3.0 defines the following technique.

| ~Parameter |                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| RUNS .     | 2 : # of Runs described in this file |
| RUN[1].    | 2 : Run number                       |
| RUN[2].    | 3 : Run number                       |

The value must be equal to the number of runs being described in the file.

**Note**: If a single run is described, it is not necessary to include or use the **RUNS** or **RUN**[] parameter or associations. The **RUN** parameter should indicate the run number.

The **RUN[]** parameters (one line per run) defines the run number for each logging run. Since there are multiple **RUN** parameters, you must use the [] index counters.

Now for any parameter in a **Parameter Data** section that is associated with each run, add the matching **RUN[]** parameter name after the | (bar) delimiter.

| BS .UNIT | 8.75 : BIT SIZE | RUN[1] |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| BS .UNIT | 6.25 : BIT SIZE | RUN[2] |

This then states that the first BS value applies to the run found in the value of the RUN[1] parameter found else where in the file (2 in this case).

Now two or more complete sets of run specific parameters can be included in a single **~Parameter** section for example.

#### **Example 2. Column Data Channel Matrix Identification**

Often there are critical parameters that are connected with certain logging data types, such as the matrix (SAND, LIME, DOLO) that was used to compute density or Neutron porosity, or environmental correction settings applied.

This becomes even more important if there are more than one of the same type of porosity channel.

Begin by building **Parameter Data** lines that describe each of the values for each applicable parameter. This example defines two sets of matrix parameters for Neutron, density and sonic porosity channels.

|                | #Service Company specific Parameters |                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| MATR[1] .      |                                      | SAND : Neutron Porosity Matrix |
| MDEN[1] .KG/M3 |                                      | 2650 : Density Porosity Matrix |
| DTMA[1] .US/M  |                                      | 182 : Sonic Porosity Matrix    |
|                |                                      |                                |
| MATR[2] .      |                                      | LIME : Neutron Porosity Matrix |
| MDEN[2] .KG/M3 |                                      | 2710 : Density Porosity Matrix |
| DTMA[2] .US/M  |                                      | 156 : Sonic Porosity Matrix    |
|                |                                      |                                |
| MATR[3] .      |                                      | DOLO : Neutron Porosity Matrix |
| MDEN[3] .KG/M3 |                                      | 2870 : Density Porosity Matrix |
| DTMA[3] .US/M  |                                      | 142 : Sonic Porosity Matrix    |

Now, in the **Column Definition** Section where each channel is defined, append the appropriate parameter name as an association parameter.

**~Curve**

| …<br>NEUT1 .V/V<br>DENS1 .V/V<br>SPOR1 .V/V |  | : Neutron Porosity<br>: Density Porosity<br>: Sonic Porosity | MATR[1]<br>  MDEN[1]<br>  DTMA[1] |
|---------------------------------------------|--|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| NEUT2 .V/V<br>DENS2 .V/V<br>SPOR2 .V/V<br>… |  | : Neutron Porosity<br>: Density Porosity<br>: Sonic Porosity | MATR[2]<br>  MDEN[2]<br>  DTMA[2] |

Now it is clear which channel was run on which matrix.

#### **Example 3. Parameter Zoning**

Associations are also used for zoning parameters. Zoning allows you to indicate that certain parameters have a certain value over a certain zone (depth interval), or that certain data channels in a **Column Data** section have certain input parameter values over certain intervals.

You need to define parameter(s) that define the zone interval(s). The Value of the parameter(s) will have two values, separated by the DLM character, indicating the starting and ending depth of this zone.

In this example, matrix parameters for Neutron, Density and sonic channels have different values over two intervals.

First define parameters that list the depths of each zone for each parameter involved.

| NMAT_DEPTH[1].unit | D1,D2 | : Neutron Matrix Depth interval |
|--------------------|-------|---------------------------------|
| NMAT_DEPTH[2].unit | D2,D3 | : Neutron Matrix Depth interval |
| DMAT_DEPTH[1].unit | D1,D2 | : Density Matrix Depth interval |
| DMAT_DEPTH[2].unit | D2,D3 | : Density Matrix Depth interval |
| SMAT_DEPTH[1].unit | D1,D2 | : Sonic Matrix Depth interval   |
| SMAT_DEPTH[2].unit | D2,D3 | : Sonic Matrix Depth interval   |

Then define parameters that list the various values of the parameters in each depth interval or zone. Add as associations the parameters that contain the depth interval that applies to each parameter value.

| MATR[1] .      |  | SAND : Neutron Porosity Matrix   NMAT_DEPTH[1] |               |
|----------------|--|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| MDEN[1] .KG/M3 |  | 2650 : Density Porosity Matrix   DMAT_DEPTH[1] |               |
| DTMA[1] .US/M  |  | 182 : Sonic Porosity Matrix                    | SMAT_DEPTH[1] |
| MATR[2] .      |  | LIME : Neutron Porosity Matrix   NMAT_DEPTH[2] |               |
| MDEN[2] .KG/M3 |  | 2710 : Density Porosity Matrix   DMAT_DEPTH[2] |               |
| DTMA[2] .US/M  |  | 156 : Sonic Porosity Matrix                    | SMAT_DEPTH[2] |

This associates each parameter value with the interval over which it applies.

As a final optional step, add each matrix parameter name as an associated parameter to each **Column Definition** line.

**~Curve**

| …         |                    |                  |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------|
| NEUT .V/V | : Neutron Porosity | MATR[1], MATR[2] |
| DENS .V/V | : Density Porosity | MDEN[1]          |
| SPOR .V/V | : Sonic Porosity   | DTMA[1]          |
| …         |                    |                  |

This excerpt from a **~Curve** section indicates that NEUT channel has two associated values of **MATR** over two different zones, while DENS and SPOR have only one matrix value that applies to the entire file.

### **Column Data and Column Definition Section Associations**

LAS 3.0 defines several new types of data that can be stored. To assist with understanding which **Column Definition** section belongs to which **Column Data** section, each **Column Data** section title line uses the association scheme to clearly indicate which **Column Definition** section it belongs with.

See full descriptions of the techniques in **Detailed Section Structure Rules, Section Title lines**, earlier in this document

# **Adding User Defined Data and Sections**

Users can define and include their own data into Ver 3.0 LAS files.

First the user needs to decide how his data relates to the previously defined data types for LAS 3.0. If they fit in within a preexisting data type, they must be placed in that section type. Add addition sections to existing section using the [1] [2] index extensions rather than creating your own.

If the data being added does not fall into one of predefined data types, then new sections may be defined.

New **Column Data** sections must be accompanied by a matching **Column Definition** section. Optionally, a matching **Parameter Data** section can be defined that contains individual related data items to that which are stored in the new **Column Data** section.

These sections must conform to the same rules for section naming and content as all **Parameter Data, Column Definition** and **Column Data** sections.

**~User_Data ~User_Definition ~User_Parameter**

Standalone _Parameter sections can also be used for unrelated one-dimensional or single item data. Be sure the data placed in these sections does not belong to one of the other data types stored in the file.

# **Appendix II: LAS Ver 3.0 Reserved Characters and Words**

Several ASCII characters and words are reserved for use by the LAS Ver 3.0 standard.

The individual characters are used to separate or "delimit" individual data fields or items in LAS files.

The restricted words are the section titles and mnemonics that are defined as part of the LAS Ver 3.0 standard content rules.

### **Delimiters**

Delimiter characters must be carefully used. Whenever possible, do not use them in the data items stored in the LAS file. Obvious exceptions are the period which appears in most numbers. Periods, Colon, Semicolon | (bar), [ ] and {} are only used as delimiters in **Parameter Data** and **Column Definition** lines, so they can be freely used in data items in **Column Data** sections.

# **Appendix III: Definitions**

### **Section Title Line**

A line beginning with ~ that contains a Section title. Common examples are **~Version**, **~Well**, **~Curve**, **~Parameter**, **~ASCII**, etc.

#### **Comment Line**

A line whose first non-space character is a # (pound) character. # characters elsewhere on a line do not indicate the start of a comment at that character position.

Example:

**#This is a comment line**

### **Format Field {}**

The format field is the characters found between a matched set of {} braces. It describes the format used to write the data value(s) referred to by the **Parameter Data** line or **Column Definition** line on which it is found.

### **Index Indicators [ ]**

Found appended to mnemonics in **Parameter Data** lines or **Column Definition** lines, to indicate that there are multiple instances of that mnemonic. Also used on section titles for the same reason.

#### **Parameter Data Section**

A section such as the **~Parameter** or **~Core_Parameter** section that contains only **Parameter Data** lines and comment lines.

#### **Parameter Data Line**

A line containing these elements within any section other than a **Column Data** section:

**MNEM.UNIT VALUE : DESCRIPTION {Format} | Assoc1 Assoc2**

Example:

**BS.IN 8.25 : Bit Size {F13.5} | Run[1]**

### **Column Definition Section**

A section such as the **~Curve** section that contains **Parameter Data** lines that describe each channel of a matching **Column Data** section

### **Column Definition Line**

A line within a **Column Data** section containing a name, unit, Log Code and Description of one channel appearing in the matching **Column Data** section. These lines share the same structure rules as the **Parameter Data** Lines.

**MNEM.UNIT VALUE : DESCRIPTION {Format} | Assoc1 Assoc2**

Example:

**CALI.IN : Caliper Channel**

### **Column Data Section**

A section such as the **~ASCII** section that contains delimited multi-**Column Data**. The description of each channel is in the **Column Definition** section associated with the **Column Data** section.

### **Column Data Line**

A single line found in a **Column Data** section such as **~ASCII** that contains delimited column style data channels.

#### **Column Data Channel**

Any single vertical column of data residing in a **Column Data** section**.**

#### **Array Spacing Indicators**

{AF**;50ms;5ft**}

For a **Column Data** channel that is a member of an Array, the **Array Spacing Indicators** are additional index information for that array member. They appear as semi-colon delimited items after the A or other Format characters within the Format field

# **Appendix IV: Termination Issues**

**Unix Line termination verses PC Line termination and its affect on the LAS Standard.**

Windows/DOS and MAC PC's ASCII files use line termination characters that are actually two consecutive characters: ASCII 13 then ASCII 10, referred to as CRLF or Carriage Return & Line Feed.

Unix systems build ASCII files with only the ASCII 10 character, referred to as LF or Line Feed.

Each type of file is properly usable on the system on which they are produced. When files are transferred between the platforms, considerable confusion is possible.

The file is judged as being LAS Ver 3.0 compliant under these rules.

- 1. If the file is CRLF (PC) terminated and resides on a PC platform computer, it is considered a valid LAS file (assuming it passes all other LAS Compliance tests).
- 2. If the file is LF only (UNIX) terminated and resides on a UNIX platform computer, it is considered a valid LAS file (assuming it passes all other LAS Compliance tests).
- 3. If termination does not match the platform, then the file is in violation of the LAS Ver 3.0 Standard.

Whether the file is actually usable on any particular computer is a matter of whether the program reading the LAS file can handle CRLF and/or LF termination properly. This varies widely. Converters are available as shareware.

The LAS Certify for Ver 3.0 LAS converts Unix terminated files to PC terminated files when run.

# **Appendix V: Real Time Data Acquisition Considerations**

Service companies have recently begun offering real time data acquisition systems.

These systems allow remote monitoring of data acquisition in the field and the remote transfer of digital data and graphic files.

One of the expected popular digital data formats for real time transfer is LAS.

The only problem this raises is a reality of the current real time file transfer protocols. These systems can only append data to remote files, it cannot change any portion of the files already transferred.

The implication for LAS is that the **STOP** parameter value in the **~Well** section, once written, cannot be changed to the correct value as the file grows with new appended data. A file with a **STOP** value that does not match the final index value in the **~ASCII** section would be a Ver 2.0 standard violation.

This is addressed in LAS Ver 3.0 by allowing the STOP value to be set to the NULL value. This is the only other legal value other than the correct value.

The **~ASCII** section final value needs to be read and the STOP value needs to be updated to this value as soon as possible.

The LAS Certify 3.0 program that is to be part of this standard, automatically performs this correction if it is encountered.

The **~ASCII** section must be the last section of the file for real time acquisition cases. The addition of new data in real time can only occur as an appending operation to the end of the file.

# **Appendix VI : LAS Certify Ver 3.0**

LAS Certify Ver 3.0.1 is a software program designed to check the compliance of any LAS ver 3.0 file to this documented standard. It is part of the LAS 3.0 standard.

The initial version (3.0.1) checks LAS structure rules only at this time. Content (presence of required Parameter data lines) in the **~Version** and **~Well** section is checked for those specific rules as outlined above.

These checks are performed. Each general group has one or more individual checks related to that group. Refer to the on-line help for further details.

- 1. File Naming, Availability, Termination and Size.
- 2. ~Version VERS, WRAP, DLM present and values correct
- 3. Line structure syntax check delimiters, format etc.
- 4. Section title syntax check.
- 5. ~Well section mnemonics check.
- 6. Units on SSS and First Index channels match.
- 7. STRT/STOP/STEP Values match ~Ascii or ~Log_Data section.
- 8. _Data sections same # of channels as matching _Definition section.
- 9. Data sections have consistent # of channels
- 10. All referenced association mnemonics present.
- 11. Array channel _Definition section syntax check.
